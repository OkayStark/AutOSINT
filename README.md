# Automated OSINT Tool

## Abstract

This project aims to develop an automated Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tool with a comprehensive set of features for data collection, enrichment, analysis, and visualization. The tool will empower investigators and analysts to gather and analyze information from various online sources efficiently and ethically. Key features include automated data collection, data enrichment and correlation, scheduled scans, alerts and notifications, geolocation and mapping, natural language processing (NLP), anonymity and privacy measures, custom plugins and extensibility, API integrations, credential monitoring, dark web monitoring, case automation workflows, reporting and evidence packaging, historical data archiving, cross-platform compatibility, resource usage optimization, intuitive command-line interface (CLI), and community support with documentation and tutorials.

## Objectives

1. **Automated Data Collection**: Develop modules for automated data collection from various online sources, such as social media platforms, websites, forums, and public databases. Allow users to specify search criteria and parameters to tailor the automated data collection to their needs.

2. **Data Enrichment and Correlation**: Implement algorithms to automatically enrich collected data with additional context and correlate information from different sources to build a comprehensive profile.

3. **Scheduled Scans**: Enable users to schedule regular scans and updates to ensure the tool continually monitors and collects new information based on predefined queries.

4. **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up an alerting system that notifies users when new relevant information is found or when certain predefined conditions are met.

5. **Geolocation and Mapping**: Integrate geolocation features to visualize and map the collected data, providing investigators with a spatial context for their analysis.

6. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Incorporate NLP capabilities to analyze and extract insights from unstructured text data, such as social media posts, articles, and forum threads.

7. **Anonymity and Privacy Measures**: Implement features to ensure the privacy and anonymity of users during data collection, respecting ethical considerations and legal constraints.

8. **Custom Plugins and Extensibility**: Allow users to develop custom plugins or scripts to extend the tool's functionality, enabling integration with new data sources or specialized OSINT techniques.

9. **API Integrations**: Provide API integrations with popular OSINT data sources, ensuring compatibility and access to a wide range of information.

10. **Credential Monitoring**: Include features for monitoring and alerting users if any compromised credentials associated with the investigated subjects are discovered online.

11. **Dark Web Monitoring**: Integrate capabilities to monitor the dark web for relevant information, providing a more comprehensive view of the online landscape.

12. **Case Automation Workflows**: Allow users to create and automate workflows for specific investigation scenarios, streamlining repetitive tasks and enhancing efficiency.

13. **Reporting and Evidence Packaging**: Generate detailed reports that include the collected data, analysis, and visualizations. Provide the ability to package evidence for legal or law enforcement purposes.

14. **Historical Data Archiving**: Implement a system for archiving historical data, enabling investigators to track changes and patterns over time.

15. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the tool is compatible with various operating systems and can be easily deployed in different environments.

16. **Resource Usage Optimization**: Optimize resource usage to ensure the tool operates efficiently, especially during large-scale data collection processes.

17. **Intuitive Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Provide a user-friendly command-line interface for users who prefer scripting and automation.

18. **Community and Documentation**: Foster a community around the tool with forums, documentation, and tutorials to support users and encourage collaboration.
